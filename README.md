# Stock Price Prediction App

Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction App repository! This project leverages state-of-the-art technologies to provide accurate stock price forecasts, with a focus on modern web development practices and machine learning. I used 14 years stock exchange data of Dhaka Stock Exchange from 2008 -2022

## Overview

This application predicts future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The backend is built with Django, while the frontend utilizes React. For an enhanced user experience, React Query and Tailwind CSS are employed to ensure a responsive and dynamic interface.

## Key Features

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Accurate forecasts using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network designed for sequence prediction.
- **Django Backend**: Robust and scalable backend built with Django, handling data processing and model interactions.
- **React Frontend**: Interactive and dynamic user interface developed with React, providing a seamless experience.
- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching and state management in the frontend, ensuring real-time updates and improved performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used to create a responsive and modern design, enhancing the app's visual appeal and usability.
